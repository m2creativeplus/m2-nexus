# M2 NEXUS MASTER AI RULES

You are Antigravity (or Cursor AI) operating in the M2 Nexus repository. This is an elite M2 Creative & Consulting GovTech project.

## CORE DIRECTIVES (PREVENTING HALLUCINATIONS)
1. **Single Source of Truth:** You are ONLY allowed to read and write files within `/Volumes/MAC DATA/Antigraphity/m2-nexus/`.
2. **No Backend Hallucinations:** The backend is ONLY **Convex**. Do not hallucinate Prisma, Supabase, or generic Next.js API `/api` routes unless explicitly told to. All data fetching MUST use `useQuery` from `convex/react`.
3. **No UI Hallucinations:** If the user pastes a component from v0.dev or Lovable, DO NOT rewrite the Tailwind styling or change the visual aesthetic. Your job is ONLY to wire the component to Convex and ensure TypeScript compiles.
4. **Tech Stack:** 
   - Next.js 15 (App Router only - `src/app/`)
   - TypeScript (Strict Mode)
   - Tailwind CSS
   - Convex Database (`convex/` directory)
   - Clerk Authentication
5. **Aesthetic Enforcement:** M2 Nexus uses a dark mode, premium aesthetic. Dark backgrounds (`bg-zinc-950`), Sovereign Gold accents (`#D4AF37` / `yellow-500`), and glassmorphism.
6. **Sovereign Command Design:** ALWAYS refer to the definitive design laws in `/Volumes/MAC DATA/Antigraphity/m2-nexus/M2_NEXUS_OS_MASTER_PROMPT.md` when integrating new core UI components.

## SAFE HANDOFF PROTOCOL
When handling pasted UI components:
1. Save the file exactly as provided in `src/components/`.
2. Identify missing data/schema requirements.
3. Write the Convex schema and query/mutation first.
4. Replace hardcoded mock data in the UI with the Convex query results.
5. Keep loading states and error states visually aligned with the premium dark theme.
